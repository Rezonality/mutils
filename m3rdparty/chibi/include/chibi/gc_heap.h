   to make accesses more efficient, the old heap and context should
   be discarded after a sucessful call to heap pack; finalizers do
   not need to be called since all active objects are in the new heap.

   result in an initial heap exactly the size of the disk image which will
   be expanded with an additional heap when the system requests storage space.
